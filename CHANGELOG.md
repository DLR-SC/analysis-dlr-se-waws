# Changelog

## 1.2.0 (2019-09-10)
- Added data about the sixth knowledge exchange workshop:
  - The new data set triggered also changes in participant data and
    location data as some participants switched from "one-time participants"
    to either "core group members" or "irregular visitors".
  - We harmonized the location abbreviations. Now, they fit with the number
    of the official DLR locations.
  - We had to correct the "non_regular" attribute of one participant. Thus,
    now, there is one less core group member. I.e., after workshop 5, the
    number of core group members is 29 instead of 30.
- Added heat map (on the basis of the library `seaborn`) to better show participation
  numbers of the main workshop locations
- Performed smaller improvements and changes of the analysis code to incorporate
  the data of the sixth workshop
- Bumped up versions of used dependencies
